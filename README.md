# React-Fitness-App
+EveryBodyFits
+  EveryBodyFits was developed by `Dylan Glover`, `Maeli Hector`, `Daniel Hayes`, and `David Grimshaw` in July of 2018 as an application to help anybody and everybody work out. The App uses `Node.js` and `Express.js` to host a page generated by `React.js` where the client can view and start various 5 minute workout routines which are timed and kept track of progress. The workouts and users are hosted on both a `Mongo` and `Firebase` databse. EveryBodyFits uses `Bootstrap` and `React-Bootstrap` for CSS stylings.
